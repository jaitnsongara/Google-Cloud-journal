# Google Cloud Platform Core Concepts

## Overview 

```
Remote 
         -Computer               ----------
         -Compute Instances      --------------> " All have 6 Primary things named as CPU, Memory, HDD, Network Card, OS, Firewall"
         -Virtual Macchines      ----------

access to the above things via your Computer is Cloud Computing

### Two Major Saleing Point for GCP 
####  Total 4 Major Points  
1. Elastic
2. Fault tolerance 
                                                                    
#### Two other are comes with above two            

3. Scaleable
4. Highly available

On Primise to Cloud 

Mainframe 
            -year 2016 10k users 
                    10 servers
            -year 2020 15k users 
                    15 serveres
    The fixed up front cost is paying well the maninance cost | 

- On the base of GCP Saleing Point the On primise Mainframe shifts towards the Cloud platform

## Introduction to Google Cloud Compute Engine

### Major Google Cloud Platform Product and Services 

- Compute
- Storage
- Big Data
- Machine Learning

#### What is VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

- Same as your 'Home Network' (Assgine the Range of Private IP)
- Cloud instances runs inside the VPC (Private Network)
  
#### Example Spotify GCP VPC

```
                                                | VPC Netwok                        |
User                                            |               Compute Instances   |
        Public Network                   <<<<Internet>>>>                           |
                                                |                                   |
```

### Google Cloud Storage 

#### Cloud Storage Buckets

- Storage the Data
- Databases and there Backups

#### What is Managed Services

- Servers with the management of resources for Compute instances
  ##### Google Managements
  - OS installation, Patches, Updates 
  - Storage 
  ##### For Unmanaged Services 
  - OS installation  
  - Loading and offloading Data
  - Strugle to maintaine the servers and there services 
      
## Conclustion

- VPC, Compute Engine, Cloud storage, Database in Google (Cloud SQL)

### GCP Global Physical infrastructure

-  Zone = Isolated Data Center (Continents)

-  Region = Geograhic Group of Zone (City)
